# shadowmatic-rl

In this project, I investigate curiosity-driven RL in a mobile 3D game which re-implemented from scratch in Unity for RL agent training.

Current results are preliminary but do not support curiosity-driven learning as defined by [Pathak et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05363). Further investigations will follow.
