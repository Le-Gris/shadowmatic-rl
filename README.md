# shadowmatic-rl

In this project, I investigate curiosity-driven RL in a mobile 3D game called [Shadowmatic](https://www.shadowmatic.com/presskit/). I re-implement the game from scratch in Unity for RL agent training using the ML-Agents library. 3D objects were taken from [this repo](https://github.com/ashih42/In-The-Shadow).

Current results are preliminary but do not support curiosity-driven learning as defined by [Pathak et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05363). Further investigations will follow.
